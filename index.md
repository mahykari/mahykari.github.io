### Research

Most of the things I like to work on live in the domains of
formal verification and software engineering.
My focus so far has been on
_monitoring_ (that is, runtime verification),
secure $n$-party computation ($n \geq 2$),
and verifiable machine learning.
I'll be happy to explore any of these topics further.
