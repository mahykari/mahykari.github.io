<p>My homeland is living through fateful days. As someone with recent
lived experience there, I write this to narrate my own story. What built
me. What broke us.</p>
<h2 id="grade-school">Grade school</h2>
<p>The Shah and the Shahbānu made it possible for every child in Iran to
go to school, to be educated and nurtured, regardless of family
background.</p>

<p>Both of my parents received their education under that pre-1979
system. They did not have to pay a single penny. I, too, went to a grade
school founded in 1953, in our own neighborhood.</p>
<p>That was not ideology. That was infrastructure. That was investment
in minds.</p>
<h2 id="english-as-a-foreign-language">English as a foreign
language</h2>
<p>To even consider a professional future, I had to learn English, and
learn it properly.</p>
<p>That path took me through the Iran Language Institute (ILI), the
place that taught me English, the place that taught me how to think and
speak in another language. To this day, I have not found a more
effective language education.</p>
<p>This institute later became associated with the <em>Institute for the
Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults</em>, known in
Persian as <em>Kānūn-e Parvaresh-e Fekri</em>.</p>

<p>Once again, this was founded by the Shahbānu, before 1979.</p>
<h2 id="higher-education">Higher education</h2>
<p>I studied at the Engineering School of the University of Tehran. It
was founded in 1934, under Reza Shah. This was the place that taught me
to be an engineer. To value clean design over quick results and only
trust what looks professional.</p>

<p>The strongest technical universities of Iran were all built before
1979. They were designed to produce engineers, scientists, builders.</p>
<p>Not ideology carriers. Builders.</p>
<h2 id="the-flip-side">The flip side</h2>
<p>This part belongs to my generation.</p>
<p>From grade school, children were forced into religious education. To
enter university, for any major, religious studies were tested. During
undergraduate studies, every student had to take around 40 ECTS of
“general knowledge” courses. Which meant religion again. The curriculum
was inflated to 280 ECTS because of this.</p>
<p>These are all artifacts of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Throughout my education, I had one survival rule: <em>Avoid
contamination. Do not let this nonsense settle in your mind.</em></p>
<p>In June 2025, at the most exhausting stage of my graduate studies in
Gugging, I went home only because I was homesick and wanted to see my
parents. Instead, the actions of the Islamic Republic forced me into a
war experience. I was not afraid of Israeli missiles. Their targets were
not civilians.</p>
<p>What crushed me was the chaos. Finding a way out. My father spending
an entire day on the phone trying to secure safety. Eventually, my
parents and I fled to Armenia. What was supposed to be rest turned into
survival.</p>
<p>Now it is January 2026. My eyes are dry from staring at screens,
waiting for news from Iran, waiting for communication blackouts imposed
by the mullahs to end, waiting to hear that my family is safe.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means">What this means</h2>
<p>In my 25 years of life, everything that built me came from the era of
the Shah. Everything that drained me, controlled me, distorted me, came
from the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The mullahs burdened my education. They filled my family’s life with
anxiety. They turned ordinary existence into constant tension.</p>
<p>I do not want clerical rule in my country. I do not want it anywhere.
Its time must end. Its grip must be broken.</p>
<p>Now that my people are standing at the edge of reclaiming their home,
I cannot “turn off the TV.” I turn the volume up.</p>
