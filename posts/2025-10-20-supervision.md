title: Academic "supervision"?

What's the role of an academic supervisor?
As the name implies, it's to _**supervise**_ graduate students.
Experience has shown me that there are many ways to interpret this;
I've "anonymized" the names in the following quotes:

> "I don't have **any** time to actually listen to you,
> but here's a postdoc to fill my role."
> 
> --- T.

> "I can throw a few ideas at you,
> but the real work is yours, and yours only."
>
> --- R.

> "I don't know how to do this,
> but you should, and I expect you to."
>
> --- M.

Notice a pattern? That's what people call _negligence_;
willingly opting out of one's responsibility.

Now, what's wrong with this?
For starters, when you sign up for a research position,
you expect the supervisor to be your main contact.
That's only reasonable,
_assuming_ the supervisor is also a reasoable person.
If he/she is not, then... you're in for a ride.
Expect wrestling with paper-thirsty postdocs
overriding you at every corner.
And that's the good case; at least you have an "ersatz" supervisor.
It would be worse if you were left on your own;
that happens far more often than people talk about.

Many people just take this as-is
and suffer the mental overload of it.
Some people change groups. Some people drop out.
I don't know which path is objectively better.
I **do** know that not getting proper mentorship,
not being guided in shaping your own ideas,
doesn't make you a good academic.
