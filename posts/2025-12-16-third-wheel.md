title: The third wheel syndrome
date: 16.12.2025

Imagine this: you’re doing a PhD, working with a postdoc.
Instead of a supervisor and a student, you get *“supervisor”*
and **supervisor** (= postdoc).

The supervisor speaks to the postdoc; the postdoc speaks to you.
Decisions, feedback, and expectations travel **one way**, already
settled by the time they arrive.

The **third wheel syndrome** is when *you* become the third wheel
in **your own supervision**.
*Structure*, they call it.
**Decisions without dialogue** is what it is.

You are **present** and **accountable**, but never a participant
in the conversation that shapes your work.
Questions get answered indirectly.
Disagreements are **already resolved**.
Appreciation, if it comes at all, arrives *second-hand*.

Decisions are made **without you**.
You're still expected to **own the outcome**.

The supervisor keeps **authority**,
but never shows up to exercise it.

This isn't collaboration.
It isn't mentorship.
It's **supervision by proxy**.

Call it *efficiency* if you want.
Call it **delegation**.
The person most affected by the decisions is the least involved in making them.

You can work around a lot of things in academia.
Being the third wheel in your own PhD isn't one of them.
**Supervision by proxy doesn't train researchers. It trains spectators.**
