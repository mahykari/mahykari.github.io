<p>Imagine this: you’re doing a PhD, working with a postdoc. Instead of
a supervisor and a student, you get <em>“supervisor”</em> and
<strong>supervisor</strong> (= postdoc).</p>
<p>The supervisor speaks to the postdoc; the postdoc speaks to you.
Decisions, feedback, and expectations travel <strong>one way</strong>,
already settled by the time they arrive.</p>
<p>The <strong>third wheel syndrome</strong> is when <em>you</em> become
the third wheel in <strong>your own supervision</strong>.
<em>Structure</em>, they call it. <strong>Decisions without
dialogue</strong> is what it is.</p>
<p>You are <strong>present</strong> and <strong>accountable</strong>,
but never a participant in the conversation that shapes your work.
Questions get answered indirectly. Disagreements are <strong>already
resolved</strong>. Appreciation, if it comes at all, arrives
<em>second-hand</em>.</p>
<p>Decisions are made <strong>without you</strong>. You’re still
expected to <strong>own the outcome</strong>.</p>
<p>The supervisor keeps <strong>authority</strong>, but never shows up
to exercise it.</p>
<p>This isn’t collaboration. It isn’t mentorship. It’s
<strong>supervision by proxy</strong>.</p>
<p>Call it <em>efficiency</em> if you want. Call it
<strong>delegation</strong>. The person most affected by the decisions
is the least involved in making them.</p>
<p>You can work around a lot of things in academia. Being the third
wheel in your own PhD isn’t one of them. <strong>Supervision by proxy
doesn’t train researchers. It trains spectators.</strong></p>
