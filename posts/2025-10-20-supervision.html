<h1 class="title">Academic “supervision”?</h1>
<p class="date">20.10.2025</p>

<p>What’s the role of an academic supervisor? As the name implies, it’s
to <em><strong>supervise</strong></em> graduate students. Experience has
shown me that there are many ways to interpret this; I’ve “anonymized”
the names in the following quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t have <strong>any</strong> time to actually listen to you,
but here’s a postdoc to fill my role.”</p>
<p>— T.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can throw a few ideas at you, but the real work is yours, and
yours only.”</p>
<p>— R.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how to do this, but you should, and I expect you
to.”</p>
<p>— M.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice a pattern? That’s what people call <em>negligence</em>;
willingly opting out of one’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, what’s wrong with this? For starters, when you sign up for a
research position, you expect the supervisor to be your main contact.
That’s only reasonable, <em>assuming</em> the supervisor is also a
reasoable person. If he/she is not, then… you’re in for a ride. Expect
wrestling with paper-thirsty postdocs overriding you at every corner.
And that’s the good case; at least you have an “ersatz” supervisor. It
would be worse if you were left on your own; that happens far more often
than people talk about.</p>
<p>Many people just take this as-is and suffer the mental overload of
it. Some people change groups. Some people drop out. I don’t know which
path is objectively better. I <strong>do</strong> know that not getting
proper mentorship, not being guided in shaping your own ideas, doesn’t
make you a good academic.</p>
